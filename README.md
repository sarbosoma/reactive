develop a reactive graphical user interface for the Wikipedia Suggestions application. This application will allow the user to enter a search term and in real time render a list of possible completions of that search term from Wikipedia. After that, a user will be able to select one of the suggested terms and click Get, which will render the desired wikipedia page.
