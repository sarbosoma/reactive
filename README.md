Principles of Reactive Programming
========

#### week1: ScalaCheck

work with the ScalaCheck library for automated specification-based testing

#### week2: Discrete Event Simulation

- simulator for logic circuits
- an epidemy simulator

#### week3: Futures

implement a simple asynchronous server using Scala Futures

#### week4: Observables

develop a reactive graphical user interface for the Wikipedia Suggestions application. This application will allow the user to enter a search term and in real time render a list of possible completions of that search term from Wikipedia. After that, a user will be able to select one of the suggested terms and click Get, which will render the desired wikipedia page.

#### week5: Actors

implement an actor-based binary tree set where each node is represented by one actor. The advantage of such an actor-based solution is that it can execute fully asynchronously and in parallel.

#### week6: Supervision + Distribution

implement a distributed, replicated storage of key-value pairs. Each node (the replicas) in this distributed system will be represented by one actor.
